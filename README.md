# MEANMapboxPlayground

This is my demo Angular app based on Mapbox GL (https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides). You'll probably need to create and provide your public API token https://account.mapbox.com/. Most of the data and objects in the app are "science fiction." It was created in November 2024 in Ukraine.

Libs and plugins I used: 
- https://github.com/Wykks/ngx-mapbox-gl - wrapper for Angular by Wykks
- mapbox-gl-draw for Drawing mode
- Angular Material for ui elements and theming
- Node.js + Express 4 + jade for server

Live demo on Vercel (hope works :-) https://mean-mapbox-playground.vercel.app/ 

## Development server

Run `npm start` for both node.js server (port 3000 by default) and frontend app on `http://localhost:4200/`. 

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
